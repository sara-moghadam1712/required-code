GMDH PROJECT description:
Group Method of Data Handling is an intelligent approach that operates in a similar pattern to artificial neural networks. 
In this system, dual combinations of input variables are created in the form of Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomials.
Based on the evaluation criteria such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and determination coefficient (R^2),
the polynomials with higher accuracy are selected and introduced to the next layer as inputs. 
This repetitive approach is used to reach the best polynomials predicting the target variable of the project. 
GMDH is a self-organized system in which the number of required layers and neurons are determined during the running process.
